# PCA-Analysis-Zica-and-Craniosyntosis
In this project, my classmates and I worked together to analyze and create data visualizations for two different diseases: zika microcephaly and craniosynostosis. Both craniosynostosis and zika microcephaly is a disease that causes abnormal head growth in fetuses, the goal of the project was to analyze gene expression of the disease during and after birth.
